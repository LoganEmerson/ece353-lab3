char *progScanner(...){} /*This reads as input a pointer to a string holding the next
line from the assembly language program, using the fgets() library function to do
so. progScanner() removes all duplicate spaces, parentheses, and commas from
it from it and a pointer to the resulting character string will be returned. Items
will be separated in this character string solely by a single space. For example
add $s0, $s1, $s2 will be transformed to add $s0 $s1 $s2. The instruction
lw $s0, 8($t0) will be converted to lw $s0 8 $t0. If, in a load or store instruction,
mismatched parentheses are detected (e.g., 8($t0( instead of 8($t0) or a missing
or extra ), ), this should be reported and the simulation should then stop.
In this simulator, we will assume that consecutive commas with nothing in between
(e.g., ,,) are a typo for a single comma, and not flag them as an error; such
consecutive commas will be treated as a single comma.*/

char *regNumberConverter(...){} /* This function accepts as input the output of
the progScanner() function and returns a pointer to a character string in which all
register names are converted to numbers.
MIPS assembly allows you to specify either the name or the number of a register.
For example, both $zero and $0 are the zero register; $t0 and $8 both refer to register
8,and so on. Your parser should be able to handle either representation. (Use the
table of registers in Hennessy and Patterson or look up the register numbers online.)
The code scans down the string looking for the $ delimiter. Whatever is to the right
of this (and to the left of a space or the end of string) is the label or number of the
register. If the register is specified as a number (e.g., $5), then the $ is stripped and
5 is left behind. If it is specified as a register name (e.g., $s0), the name is replaced
by the equivalent register number). If an illegal register name is detected (e.g., $y5)
or the register number is out of bounds (e.g., $987), an error is reported and the
simulator halts*/


struct inst parser(...){} /* This function uses the output of regNumberConverter().
The instruction is returned as an inst struct with fields for each of the fields of MIPS
assembly instructions, namely opcode, rs, rt, rd, Imm. Of course, not all the fields
will be present in all instructions; for example, beq will have just two register and
one Imm fields.
Each of the fields of the inst struct will be an integer. You should use
the enumeration type to conveniently describe the opcodes, e.g., enum inst

void WB(...){} /* These
functions simulate activity in each of the five pipeline stages. All data, structural,
and control hazards must be taken into account. Keep in mind that several operations
are multicycle and that these stages are themselves not pipelined. For
example, if an add takes 4 cycles, the next instruction cannot enter EX until these
cycles have elapsed. This, in turn, can cause IF to be blocked by ID. Branches will
be resolved in the EX stage. We will cover in the lectures some some issues related
to realizing these functions.
Keep in mind that the only requirement is that the simulator be cycle-by-cycle
register-accurate. You donâ€™t have to simulate the control signals. So, you can
simply pass the instruction from one pipeline latch to the next.*/
